# Clever
A remastered version of "Clever" using HTML5 Canvas and Webpack



## Origin

Clever was originally a game my brother and I created around 2009 and one of my first programming experiences. It was made with "Game Maker 6" and compiled on Windows XP. Therefore it couldn't be played on any other system afterwards.

With my brother's birthday comming closer I was thinking about a present for him and decided to make the game playable again. 
To grasp the original experience I first tried to run it on a VM of Windows 10 what obviously didn't work because the Windows 10 VM sucks and only makes problems.

So I setup a VM for Windows XP and got the game running, took screenshots and prepared the project. After finishing the game (it took forever as I didn't remembered making 47 levels) I decided that 10 level will be enough for my new version.

## Setup

The technologies used for this project are:

* HTML5 Canvas
* Webpack

To start webpack for development run `npm run webpack` in the root directory of this project.

To build a production ready version run `npm run build`.
